# Contributing

Heya! Welcome to Directus, and thank you for taking the time to contribute back to our project! ❤️

There are many ways in which you can contribute, but before you do, please make sure you're aware of
[the Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct). Our contributors and maintainers work extremely hard to maintain
Directus as premium open-source software. Please be respectful of those efforts throughout our ecosystem. **Trolling,
harassing, insulting, or other unacceptable behavior by participants will not be tolerated.**

## Report a Bug

If you happen to run into a bug, please post an issue on
[our main GitHub Issue board](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues).

Please be as detailed as you can in the bug report. The more information available, the easier it is for other
contributors to help you find a solution. For example, it might be worth adding a schema snapshot file or a database
dump.

## Request a New Feature

If you have a great idea for an improvement of the platform, or any other feedback, please make sure to open a new
discussion on [our GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions). Feature requests are
reviewed and triaged according to our feature request workflow. For more information, please see:

	text="Feature requests are reviewed and triaged according to this process"

## Answer Questions

The Directus community is growing quickly, which also means there are more and more people with questions. Helping out
your fellow developers by providing answers on [Discord](https://directus.chat) is a great way to help the project.

## Create a Pull Request

The whole Directus project is open source, and community code contributions are always welcome! Fixing issues or
implementing new features is an excellent way to contribute back to the platform.

Please do make sure you read through [our Pull Request Process](/contributing/pull-request-process) before you start!
That ensures you have the highest likelihood that your contribution will make it to the core codebase.

## Report Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability within a Directus product or service, please reach out to us
directly over email: [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io). We will then open a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories) for tracking the fix.

We value the members of the independent security research community who uncover issues and work with our core team to
release patches. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release notes. In order to receive credit,
security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:

- They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Directus team releasing a fix for it
- They do not divulge exact details of the issue, for example exploits or proof-of-concepts

## Translate the App

Every button, element, and other pie of text in the app is fully translatable, providing full internationalization for
the Directus platform. [Our Crowdin integration](https://locales.directus.io) makes creating and updating translations a
breeze.
